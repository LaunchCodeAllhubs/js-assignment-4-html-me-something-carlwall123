      My personal journey: <br> 
      <article class = "paragraph1"> <p2> <br> Ever since I was 16 I had such a good work ethic but I was very weary of college and did not know what my path 
      in life would be. It was a very scary feeling. I started working server jobs from the time I was 16-18. It was fun, I 
      got to make some good friends and fun memories but it just wasn't bringing in enough cash flow for me. So I moved into factory jobs
      from the time I was 18-22. Turns out that still wasn't cutting it for me, I mean the money was "ok" but the work was not for me 
      at all. I came to the conclusion that I need to do something that I really enjoy and that is working for myself. <br>
      </p2> </article>

      <article class = "paragraph2"> <p3> <br>In 2020 I quit my job and started to get into real estate. I had some pretty good success doing that. We flipped two houses
      by 2023. I know it doesn't sound very income producing and truthfully it wasn't for the amount of time we had taken on them but it did 
      allow me to be more aware about the people you choose to do business with and the whole aspect of house flipping and real estate as a whole. In the middle of that
      whole process in 2022 I began my trucking business "Cargo On The Run LLC" where I would get contracts from Amazon and deliver them to post 
      offices. This was a big step for me as it was the very first business I owned by myself. This was a rough one. I felt that I kind of rushed
      myself into everything not wanting to fail. By the end of it, my total income for the 8 months I operated was around $50,000 and my expenses were around $49,000.
      Towards the end I realized this is not what I want, I didn't enjoy driving trucks and the transportation business. This was a big failure that turned into
      a very great lesson for me. My girlfriend was very supportive of the whole process and brought me up when I was feeling down. In the end 
      it was great that I tried it because I had been thinking about it for a while! <br>

      <article id = "testP" class = "funParagrapgh"> <p4> <br>Fast forward to 2023. Me and my girlfriend have been talking for a while about starting a candle business and honestly it worked out perfectly.
      We are expecting to launch "Room Three LLC" in September of 2023! Things just got brighter for me. We took a trip to Boise, ID to visit her 
      parents, and this is when we started talking about our futures and what we want to do along with the candle business. I  told her I have 
      always had a very high interest in how computers work and how everything is programmed to do what we want. That is when I got on google and 
      started doing some research. I scrolled past LaunchCode and scrolled back, after doing research on multiple different boot camps, I figured LaunchCode
      would be the best fit for me. I am so glad I took the leap and went forward with it. I have no doubt that it will be something that I won't regret because
      this is something I can see myself doing for the rest of my life! <br> <footer> <br>Â© 2023 Carl Wallace </footer> </article>
